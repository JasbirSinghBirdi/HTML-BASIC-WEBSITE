A fast-paced Western novel from the the author of Grit and The Law Wranglers series.

Thad Locke was not surprised to discover a dead body in the aftermath of a fire on a small homestead in the Kansas Flint Hills. That the cause of death appeared to be a bullet hole through the skull, however, was a surprise. When a member of the Locke family goes missing shortly thereafter, and the sheriff and his deputies are slow to act, the Locke family takes matters into their own hands. As the Lockes begin to piece together clues linking the two, a fiery and deadly climax becomes inevitable.

Unfolding in mere days, Hell's Fire is an enthralling story about who is going to stand with you when the chips are down.
